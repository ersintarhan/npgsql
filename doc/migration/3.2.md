The first beta of Npgsql 3.2 has been released and is available on nuget.org - don't forget to turn on prerelease to install with nuget. The main focus of 3.2 is performance, see below for more details.

# New Features

* Prepared statements are now persistent (survive beyond pooled connection close/open), providing significant performance improvements for applications with short-lived connections, such as most webapps ([#483](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/483)). Also, statements can optionally be prepared automatically by Npgsql based on use, unlocking prepared statement performance for O/RMs and data layers which don't prepare themselves, such as Dapper or Entity Framework Core ([#1237](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1237)). See [this blog post for more info](http://www.roji.org/prepared-statements-in-npgsql-3-2).
* Npgsql's custom logging has been replaced with [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging), making it easy to log to most providers, and providing structured logging as well for providers such as Serilog ([#1184](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1184)).
* Kerberos login ("integrated security") is now support on Linux/Mac ([#1079](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1079)).
* Support for System.Transactions and distributed transactions has been totally rewritten, and should have fewer problems than before ([#122](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/122)).
* Performance counters have been implemented, [similar to what SqlClient provides](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms254503(v=vs.110).aspx). See [the documentation for more information](../performance.md#performance-counters) ([#619](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/619)).
* If you're application attempts to make use of more than one connection at the same time, an "operation already in progress" was thrown. This exception now provides more information to help you track down the bug ([#1248](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1248)).

Many other small changes have been made, especially with regards to performance. [Here's the full list](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/milestone/24?closed=1).

# Breaking Changes from 3.1

* If you used Npgsql's logging, you will have to replace it with the new Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.
* The `Buffer Size` connection string parameter has been replaced by `Read Buffer Size` and `Write Buffer Size`.
